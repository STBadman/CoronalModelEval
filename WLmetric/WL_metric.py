This module shall provide capability to :
1) <CREATE MAP> Create a WL Carrington map assimilating SOHO/LASCO data over one carrington rotation, save as fits file
2) <EXTRACT OBSERVED NL> Load a pre-computed fits file and apply Poirier routines to extract contour 
3) <DO WL SCORE> Read in an "observed NL" map and "modeled NL" map, compute normalized distance between curves
